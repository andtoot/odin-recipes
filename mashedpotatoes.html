        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my personal favorite vegan mashed potatoe recipe. I based this off of my families simple non vegan recipe my grandmother taught me, and just ajusted it until it matched the flavors
            I like. This one is nice because you can easily adjust or add ingredients to make it your own!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>This recipe can be made with any kind of potatoes, though i prefer using red or russet to avoid peeling.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large bag of preferred potatoes. Red potatoes will have a slight sweetness</li>
            <li>3/4 cup vegan mayo</li>
            <li>vegan butter/ oil</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>get a large pot of water and fill it with water. Keep to the side. If you are using idaho potatoes you will need to peel them first. When peeling place them in the water to keep them from turning brown
                You will likely have to change out the water after peeling. For larger potatoes, chop them in to eighths, for smaller potatoes, chopping in half is fine. Place them in the water. The water should completely cover the potatoes. 
                Put them on the stove on medium to high heat. Cover until water begins to boil.
            </li>
            <li> Check potatoes by stabbing them with a fork. They will be done cooking when the fork easily pokes in and out with little  to no resistence.
            </li>
            <li> Once they are done, carefully drain all the hot water. Begin mashing the potatoes with a potatoe masher. 
                Add the vegan butter a little at a time. You should only need 2 - 3 tblspns. You can always add more later. 
                Mash the butter into the potatoes. Add the vegan mayo and mash into the potatoes. They should start to becom much fluffier.
            </li>
            <li> Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
