        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>pour 2 tbl spn of olive oil int a large pan and begin heating it on medium heat
                Begin chopping the onion. You can chop them to whatever size you like I personally prefer to make them smaller. You should
                also take this time to chop the garlic, carrots, and beyond sausage. 
            </li>
            <li> When the oil is hot begin carmelizing onions and carrots. Once the onions have begun to turn a golden brown you can add the 
                frozen peas, garlic, beyond sausage, beyond ground meat, mushrooms, salt, and pepper.
            </li>
            <li> Once everything is fully cooked add the can of tomato paste and stir it into everything. Add 1 cup of water and sautee for 30 minutes. Add flour if it needs to be thicker.</li>
            <li> Make mashed potatoes and grate cheese if needed. Get a large deep baking dish and pour all of the contents from the pan into the dish. Evenly spread the mashed potatoes on top.
                Sprikle the chese over the top of everything.
            </li>
            <li> Bake at 350 degrees for 2 hours</li>
        </ol>
