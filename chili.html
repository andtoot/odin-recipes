        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the vegan chili recipe I made up looking at several non vegan recipes and just playing around with it
            until I got something I liked. Its basic and always turns out well. A great recipe during the cold winter months served with cornbread or rice.

            <li>1 can of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1-2 tblspns of olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Start by preparing vegetables. Chop the onions garlic and bell peppers. You can chop as finely as you prefer.
                Pour olive oil into a large pan and begin heating the pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot add the bell peppers. After bell peppers Have started to soften add 
                the garlic, onions, and tomatoes. Cook until garlic and onions begin to carmelize.
            </li>
            <li> Add frozen corn. Chop tofu onto small pieces, and add to pan. You can leave the tofu in cubes if you like, but I prefer to mash it.
            </li>
            <li>Begin adding tomatoe paste. Wash and add beans. Fill one can with water and add that to the pot.</li>
            <li> Begin adding spices. I usually dont measure but add and taste as I go until it's where I like it.
            </li>
            <li> Cook over medium heat and covered for 20 - 30 minuts, checking to stir and make sure the water has not evaporated. You can always add more water if needed.</li>
        </ol>
